Why *HR*?

HR stands for Heart-Rate. Spotify HR implements a unique Heart-Rate based shuffle feature.
When enabled the songs in your current playlist will be shuffled to match your current heart rate during playback.
With faster and higher tempo songs being played as your heart rate increases.
A nice addition to enjoy matching music to any varied workout.
